Assumptions
•
•
•
•
An in-memory data store (array) is used instead of a persistent database.
The search endpoint filters by product name only, implemented as a basic feature.
No external dependencies (e.g., database or cloud services) are configured, focusing on core API
logic.
Error handling covers invalid inputs, non-existent products, and server issues.CI/CD
A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run tests automatically on push and pull requests.
Notes
•
•
•
Ensure Node.js is installed (version 16 or later recommended).
The codebase follows a modular structure with service and controller layers.
The README, code, and tests are designed to meet the technical assessment requirements.
